			<h2>EXPLORE-AI<br> The Digital Water<br> Utility of the Future.</h2>
			<p>In our view of the Digital Utility of the Future, there are three main enablers for a digital foundation: a new digital model that leverages agile methodologies, digital capabilities building, and a world class digital engine strategy that combines DevOps and a Digital Twin core. Based on the challenges faced by water companies in the next decade, we believe there are key domains to digitise over the next 10 years:</p>

                                <p>We’re also working with a small data analytics start-up called EXPLORE-AI. We
                                    certainly weren’t walking blind before those incidents. We had a lot of data, but we
                                    weren’t always tapping into it. If you think about servers and production
                                    facilities, there are a lot of operational technologies measuring reservoir levels
                                    and so on. There is a system of control on those levels which triggers an alarm when
                                    those levels are exceeded. That is a system that continually uses data to predict an
